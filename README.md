You all know the very famous Battleship game. Well, I hope
so.
You must code a terminal version of this game.
The two players are ONLY allowed to comunicate using the
signals SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2.
The map size is 8x8. On each turn, you must display your positions, and then your enemyâ€™s positions.
